# Head-finding Plugin

A little Minecraft plugin you can download [here](https://github.com/Inktest/headfinding-mc-plugin/releases/tag/new-version) to track head breaking.

Once a player breaks a head, it shows in chat who broke the head and who's head it was, as well as appearing as a scoreboard in the side.
## COMMANDS
```

/heads giveheads -- Gives every player online

/heads start -- Starts the tracking of heads

/heads stop -- Stops the tracking of heads and clears the scoreboard

```
