# Head-finding Plugin

A little Minecraft plugin you can download [here](https://github.com/Inktest/headfinding-mc-plugin/releases) to track head breaking.

Once a player breaks a head, it shows in chat who broke the head and who's head it was, as well as appearing as a scoreboard in the side.

## COMMANDS
(Permission: heads.commands)
```

/heads giveheads -- Gives every player online

/heads start -- Starts the tracking of heads

/heads stop -- Stops the tracking of heads

/heads count -- Shows the score of each player

```
